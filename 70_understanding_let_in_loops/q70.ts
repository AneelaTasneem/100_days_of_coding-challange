// Question 70: Understanding let in Loops: Write a function that uses a loop with the let keyword to print numbers from 1 to 5. Explain how the let keyword affects the visibility of the loop variable.

// This function prints numbers from 1 to 5 using a loop
function useLetToPrintnumber() {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // Logs numbers 1 through 5
  }
}
//Executes for loop to print numbers 1 to 5 in new lines:
useLetToPrintnumber();
