// Question 65: Determine the Remainder: Make a function that gets two numbers and shows the leftover from dividing them using the % sign. For example, remainder(5, 2) should give 1.

//This function will divide the values to find remainder:
function determineTheRemainder(number1 : number, number2 :number) {
 // give back the leftover by dividing values:
    return number1 %number2  
}
// 5 divided by two:
console.log(determineTheRemainder(5,2));
