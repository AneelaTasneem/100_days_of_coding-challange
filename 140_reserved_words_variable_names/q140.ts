//Question 140: Explain the error that occurs when trying to use a reserved word as a variable name.

//Reserved words, also known as keywords, are predefined and have special meanings in the language. They cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or labels) because they are reserved for specific purposes in the language syntax.

let class = "someClass";

// This error occurs because class is a reserved word in JavaScript used for defining classes, and it cannot be used as a variable name. To fix this error, we should choose a different variable name that is not a reserved word.
