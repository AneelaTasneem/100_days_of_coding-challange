//Question 119: Create a while loop that logs "Hello, World!" 5 times.

// Initialize a variable named count to 0
let count = 0;

// Continue looping as long as count is less than 5
while (count < 5) {
    // Output "Hello, World!" to the console
    console.log("Hello, World!");

    // Increment the value of count by 1
    count++;
}
